# mini-message-board

Super simple project to help get the hang of using Express and EJS.  Also learned how to publish it to Heroku -> https://agile-beach-93965.herokuapp.com/

This project doesn't use a database, so of the MVC architecture it's just using the Views and Routes (ie Controller).  The next project will put everything together for my first full-stack app.
